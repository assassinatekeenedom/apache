A continuous (for UI) development environment; deliver static content directly from your repository instead of from the JBoss AS.
	
	== EFFECTS ==	
	(1) http://localhost/
		(*) Becomes a gateway for http://[any-portal]:8080/
		(*) "Man in the Middle" delivery of static resource requests.
		
	== BENEFITS ==
	(1) Run "your" static resources (js/html/css), without re-building/deploying.
		(*) Not a hot-deploy edit, which could be lost.
	(2) Swap branches of (static) code without re-building/deploying.
	(3) Point at any development server (Local/MISC/PLATFORM_AHP/etc), without re-building/deploying.
		(*) You do NOT even have to update your system/hosts file (DNS).
		
	== SETUP ==
	(1) Run the .bat file of the environment you want to develop against.
		(*) You will automatically be prompted to provide a portal repo.
	(2) Quickly change environments or repositories (with setRepo.bat).
