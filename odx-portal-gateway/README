A continuous (for UI) development environment; deliver static content directly from your repository instead of from the JBoss AS.
	
	== EFFECTS ==	
	(1) http://localhost/
		(*) Becomes a gateway for http://[any-portal]:8080/
		(*) **MAN IN THE MIDDLE** delivery of static resource requests.
		
	== BENEFITS ==
	(1) Run "your" static resources (js/html/css), without re-building/deploying.
		(*) Not a hot-deploy edit, which could be lost.
	(2) Swap branches of (static) code without re-building/deploying.
	(3) Point at any development server (Local/MISC/PLATFORM_AHP/etc), without re-building/deploying.
		(*) You do NOT even have to update your system/hosts file (DNS).
		
	== SETUP ==
	(1) Download this repository and place it at **C:\** with the name **apache** and access **C:\apache\odx-portal-gateway**.  
		(*) This directory contains all of the scripts needed to operate the gateway.
	(2) Run the .bat file of the environment you want to develop against.
		(*) You will automatically be prompted to provide a portal repo.
	(3) Quickly change environments or repositories (with setRepo.bat).
	
	== START ==
	(1) LOCALHOST.bat
	(2) PLATFORM_AHP.bat
	(3) MISC.bat
	(4) ENTERPRISE.bat
	(5) ENTERPRISE1.bat
	
	== MAN IN THE MIDDLE ==
	(1) setRepo.bat
		(*) Executed automatically by .startOdxPortal.bat if certain hidden data files are not present.
		(*) Select the file-system location of the git or svn repo that will serve the static content.
		(*) The developer should prepare their IDE(s) to point to the file-system location provided (as appropriate).
	(2) .startOdxPortal.bat
		(*) Invoked along with the **domain** of the deployed odx-portal (git or svn).
		(*) http://localhost/ now replaces previous use of http://[**domain**]:8080/
		(*) The configured repository will be the **live domain** code being executed.
