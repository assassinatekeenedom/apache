A continuous (for UI) development environment; deliver static content directly from your *repository* **instead of** from the *application server*.
# EFFECTS #
 1.  http://localhost/
    +  Becomes a gateway for http://[**domain**]:8080/
    +  **MAN IN THE MIDDLE** delivery of configured static resource requests.
# SETUP #

Designed to be run and managed from the command line.

## Place this repository at **C:\\** and do not change the name. ##
-  **cd C:\\apache\\gateway**
	-  This directory contains all of the scripts needed to operate the gateway.
	-  **If you do have to change the name or location; update the conf/original/httpd.conf file**.

 1.  Run **LOCALHOST.bat** or **.start.bat domain** to turn on the service.
	-  You will automatically be prompted to provide the intercepting repository location.
	-  You will access the service through your browser at http://localhost/
 2.  Quickly change environments or repositories (with **.start.bat** and **setRepo.bat** respectively).
 3.  This setup assumes there is a running application server hosting the target repository (from **setRepo.bat** and **context.bat**) at the target environment's port 8080.
	*  You can run this repository gateway at any time, regardless of the application server state.
	*  You can leave this service running as long as desired if no configurations change.
		* It will always perform its part of the process without causing errors or crashes.
 4.  This setup assumes you're using windows with the following services (on the system's PATH):
	*  java
	*  git (optional, iff svn set)
	*  svn (optional, iff git set)
	*  mvn
 5.  Other assumed to exist pre-configured services
	*  sonar
	*  application server
# START #
 1.  LOCALHOST.bat
 2.  .start.bat **domain**
# MAN IN THE MIDDLE #
 1.  setRepo.bat 
	-  Executed automatically by .start.bat if certain hidden data files are not present.
	-  Select the file-system location of the git or svn repo that will serve the static content.
		- needs to be scrubbed; assumes hard-coded contexts, paths, and ports.
	-  The developer should prepare their IDE(s) to point to the file-system location provided (as appropriate).
 2. .start.bat
	-  Invoked along with the **domain** of the deployed repository code (git or svn).
	-  http://localhost/ now replaces previous use of http://[**domain**]:8080/
	-  The configured repository will be the **live domain** code being executed.
