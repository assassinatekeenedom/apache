A continuous (for UI) development environment; deliver static content directly from your *repository* **instead of** from the *application server*.
## EFFECTS ##
 1.  http://localhost/
    +  Becomes a gateway for http://[**domain**]:8080/
    +  **MAN IN THE MIDDLE** delivery of configured static resource requests.
## SETUP ##
 1.  ### Place this repository at **C:\\** and do not change the name. ###
	*  **cd C:\\apache\\gateway**
		*  This directory contains all of the scripts needed to operate the gateway.
 2.  Run LOCALHOST.bat or ".start.bat **domain**" to turn on the service.
	*  You will automatically be prompted to provide a portal repo.
	*  You will access the service through your browser at http://localhost/
 3.  Quickly change environments or repositories (with .start.bat and setRepo.bat respectively).
 4.  This setup assumes there is a running version of the repository application at the target environment's port 8080 (default web application server).
	*  You can run this service at any time, regardless of if the application server is running.
	*  You can leave this service running when stopping and starting the application server.
## START ##
 1.  LOCALHOST.bat
 2.  .start.bat **domain**
## MAN IN THE MIDDLE ##
 1.  setRepo.bat 
	*  Executed automatically by .start.bat if certain hidden data files are not present.
	*  Select the file-system location of the git or svn repo that will serve the static content.
	*  The developer should prepare their IDE(s) to point to the file-system location provided (as appropriate).
 2. .start.bat
	*  Invoked along with the **domain** of the deployed repository code (git or svn).
	*  http://localhost/ now replaces previous use of http://[**domain**]:8080/
	*  The configured repository will be the **live domain** code being executed.
