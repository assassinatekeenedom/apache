# Gateway
This is an Apache HTTPD web server that has been configured to act as a reverse proxy (gateway); and more specifically (for now) to provide a continuous UI (static resource) development environment.  It dynamically configures itself to provide you **MAN IN THE MIDDLE** access to your static resources instead of having them served from the JBoss AS deployment.
```
NO building, No deploying for static (js/html/css/etc) changes.
Test code live pointing to any deployment environment (local/team/etc).
Access through http://localhost/ instead of http://[domain]:8080/.
```
## Now with User Story support
createUserStory.bat is available for creating a single folder structure that manages both git and svn repos.

# README
A continuous (for UI) development environment; deliver static content directly from your repository instead of from the JBoss AS.
## EFFECTS	
 1.  http://localhost/
    +  Becomes a gateway for http://[any-portal]:8080/
    +  **MAN IN THE MIDDLE** delivery of static resource requests.
## BENEFITS
 1.  Run "your" static resources (js/html/css), without re-building/deploying. 
	*  Not a hot-deploy edit, which could be lost.
 2.  Swap branches of (static) code without re-building/deploying.
 3.  Point at any development server (Local/Team/UAT/Stage/Prod/etc), without re-building/deploying.
	*  You do NOT even have to update your system/hosts file (DNS).
## SETUP
 1.  Place the **gateway** at **C:\\** with the name **apache**.
	*  **cd C:\\apache\\gateway**
	*  This directory contains all of the scripts needed to operate the gateway.
 2.  Run the .bat file of the environment you want to develop against.
	*  You will automatically be prompted to provide a portal repo.
 3.  Quickly change environments or repositories (with setRepo.bat).
## START
 1.  LOCALHOST.bat
## MAN IN THE MIDDLE
 1.  setRepo.bat 
	*  Executed automatically by .start.bat if certain hidden data files are not present.
	*  Select the file-system location of the git or svn repo that will serve the static content.
	*  The developer should prepare their IDE(s) to point to the file-system location provided (as appropriate).
 2. .start.bat
	*  Invoked along with the **domain** of the deployed repository code (git or svn).
	*  http://localhost/ now replaces previous use of http://[**domain**]:8080/
	*  The configured repository will be the **live domain** code being executed.
